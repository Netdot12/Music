 <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <pre>
  This could be a good night for good times
Say you look like a good time
We're dancing to Dancing in the Moonlight
Now I want you bad
Can you make me feel better?
This could be a good night for good times
Say you look like a good time
We're dancing to Dancing in the Moonlight
Now I want you bad
Can you make me feel better?
Do you think you're better off alone?
I think you better come along
Can you make me feel better?
This could be a good night for good times
Say you look like a good time
We're dancing to Dancing in the Moonlight
Now I want you bad
Can you make me feel better?
Do you think you're better off alone?
I think you better come along
So if you think you're better off alone
I think you better come along
Can you make me feel better?
This could be a good night for good times
Say you look like a good time
We're dancing to Dancing in the Moonlight
Now I want you bad
Can you make me feel better?
Do you think you're better off alone?
(Alone, alone, alone, alone?)
I think you better come along
(Along, along, along, along)
