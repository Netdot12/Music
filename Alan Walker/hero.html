  <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <pre>
    
    Been here before, it's in my muscle memory
I'm pretty sure I recognize you
There is somethin' in your eyes
Won't let you get away tonight
You leave me in the dark
I'm stumblin' around like I'm a question mark
Wonderin' if you're around to catch me if I fall
If I come crashin' to the wall
Will you light me up, jumpstart my heart?
I need someone before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now?
Some kind of hero
I can't breathe
Hopin' you're here to rescue me
Before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now?
Some kind of hero
Been here before, it's in my muscle memory
I'm pretty sure I've felt this energy
There's somethin' in your touch
Somethin' reminded me of us
Will you light me up, jumpstart my heart?
I need someone before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now?
Some kind of hero
I can't breathe
Hopin' you're here to rescue me
Before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now?
Some kind of hero
Some kind of hero
Da, da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
