    Norwegian DJ Alan Walker is a hot commodity at the moment, and thanks in part to a somber new single with Swedish singer-songwriter Winona Oak, ‘World We Used To Know,’ he seems set to stay on fire.



According to a post on Walker’s Instagram, the song is due to be to track 11 on his upcoming second album, ‘World of Walker.’ With a release date of November 26th, the highly anticipated sophomore effort comes nearly three years to the date after his debut, ‘Different World.’

  <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <p>
    
Wild, wild, wild horses, tell me<br>
Where did they all go?<br>
They used to run, used to run, used to run right here<br>
And all I see is an empty road<br>

Wild, wild, wild roses tell me<br>
Where did they all go?<br>
When I was young, I was young, they would spread like fire<br>
And now the roots don't know where to grow<br>

Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?<br>
It's out of our hands and it's out of control<br>
I don't think that this is the world we used to know<br>
Is the world we used to know<br>

Wide, wide, wide oceans, tell me<br>
Where do you lead?<br>
When the sun and the sky come to meet at night<br>
I wonder, would you carry me?<br>

Why won't you tell me if I'm on my own<br>
You used to be, used to be, used to be right here<br>
And now I don't know where to go<br>

Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?<br>
It's out of our hands and it's out of control<br>
I don't think that this is the world we used to know<br>
Is the world we used to know<br>

I could show you places that we had<br>
In the world we used to know<br>
Take me home and show me love can last<br>
There's a world we used to know<br>

Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?<br>
It's out of our hands and it's out of control<br>
I don't think that this is the world we used to know<br>
Is the world we used to know<br>
