"Endless Summer" is a song by Norwegian music producer Alan Walker and Zak Abel.

For Walker, summer is the most anticipated season. It's the season where he creates the most memorable moments, meeting various people while traveling and spending time with family and friends. That's why he wanted to create a summer soundtrack that captures this feeling and blissful moments. Zak Abel's vocals nailed it and translated it all perfectly. I hope you all enjoy "Endless Summer" just like I do!

  <p>
    Endless summer<br>
    Lost love, now it's back again<br>
    I've been right here waiting<br>
    One touch and somethings in the air<br>
    Got my heartbeat racing<br>
    I got that feeling again<br>
    Like it's an endless summer<br>
    I got that feeling again<br>
    Like it's an endless summer<br><br>
    No time for regrets<br>
    No time for sleep, yeah<br>
    Not freaking leaving<br>
    When you're with me, yeah<br>
    I got that feeling again<br>
    Like it's an endless summer<br>
    I got that feeling again<br><br>
    Hands up, raise them to the sky<br>
    'Cause I got you by my side<br>
    It's all love every single time (single time)<br>
    And it takes me higher<br>
    I got that feeling again<br>
    Like it's an endless summer<br>
    I got that feeling again<br>
    Like it's an endless summer<br><br>
    No time for regrets<br>
    No time for sleep, yeah<br>
    Not freaking leaving<br>
    When you're with me, yeah<br>
    I got that feeling again<br>
    Like it's an endless summer<br>
    I got that feeling again<br><br>
    Ohh-whoa<br>
    I got that feeling again<br><br>
    Rain, rain go away<br>
    Summer's here to stay<br>
    Cheers to better days (endless summer)<br>
    Rain, rain go away<br>
    Summer's here to stay<br>
    Cheers to better days<br>
    I got that feeling again<br>
    Like it's an endless summer<br>
    I got that feeling again<br>
    Like it's an endless summer<br><br>
    No time for regrets<br>
    No time for sleep, yeah<br>
    Not freaking leaving<br>
    When you're with me, yeah<br>
    I got that feeling again (that feeling again)<br>
    Like it's an endless summer
