    "Fade" by Alan Walker is often regarded as an earlier, instrumental version of his more well-known track "Faded." The instrumental "Fade" shares similarities in terms of melody and electronic elements with "Faded." Both tracks have a similar musical structure and atmosphere, with "Faded" incorporating vocals to enhance the overall composition. Essentially, "Fade" provides a glimpse into the musical foundation that later evolved into the more complete version, "Faded," with its vocals adding an extra layer to the instrumental base.
