    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
   <p>
   We used to hide under the covers<br>
Serenade each other with careless melodies<br>
Something buried deep inside us<br>
The major and the minor, we're like piano keys<br>
You played for me<br>
You played for me, oh<br>
You played for me<br>
I swear it, even in my sleep<br>
I hear it like the memory<br>
Of everything we used to be<br>
You played for me<br>
You played for me<br>
You played for me<br>
We couldn't stop the world from turning<br>
It was like a whirlwind, scattered us like leaves
<br>But I'm stuck inside a feeling, a song that never leaves<br>
We were like a symphony<br>
You played for me<br>

You played for me, oh<br>
You played for me<br>
I swear it, even in my sleep<br>
I hear it like the memory<br>
Of everything we used to be<br>
You played for me<br>
You played for me<br>
You played for me<br>
You and me<br>
You and me<br>
You and me<br>
You and me<br>
You and me<br>
You and me<br>
You played for me<br>
I swear it, even in my sleep<br>
I hear it like the memory<br>
Of everything we used to be<br>
You played for me
