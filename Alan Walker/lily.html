    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
   <p>
   
Lily was a little girl<br>
Afraid of the big, wide world<br>
She grew up within her castle walls<br>
Now and then, she tried to run<br>
And then on a night with the setting sun<br>
She went in the woods away<br>
So afraid, all alone<br>
They warned her, don't go there<br>
There's creatures who are hidin' in the dark<br>
Then somethin' came creepin<br>
It told her, "Don't you worry, " just<br>
Follow everywhere I go<br>
    Top of all the mountains or valley low<br>
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of<br>
Just let me in, ooh<br>
Everything you want in gold<br>
I'll be the magic story you've been told<br>
And you'll be safe under my control<br>
Just let me in, ooh<br>
Just let me in, ooh<br>
She knew she was hypnotized<br>
And walking on cold, thin ice<br>
Then it broke, and she awoke again<br>
Then she ran faster and<br>
Start screamin', "Is there someone out there?<br>
Please help me, come get me"<br>
Behind her, she can hear it say<br>
Follow everywhere I go<br>
Top of all the mountains or valley low<br>
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of<br>
Just let me in, ooh<br>
Everything you want in gold<br>
I'll be the magic story you've been told<br>
And you'll be safe under my control<br>
Just let me in, ooh<br>
Just let me in, ooh<br>
Everything you want in gold<br>
I'll be the magic story you've been told<br>
nd you'll be safe under my control<br>
Just let me in, ooh<br>
Follow everywhere I go			
Top of all the mountains or valley low<br>
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of<br>
Just let me in, ooh<br>
Then she ran faster and<br>
Start screamin', "Is there someone out there?<br>
Please help me"<br>
Just let me in, ooh<br>
