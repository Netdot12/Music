    Lyrics
  </h2>
<p>
    All we know<br>
Left untold<br>
Beaten by a broken dream<br>
Nothing like what it used to be
(Used to be)<br>
We've been chasing our demons down an empty road<br>
Been watching our castle turning into dust<br>
Escaping our shadows just to end up here, once more<br>
And we both know<br>
This is not the world we had in mind<br>
But we got time<br>
We are stuck on answers we can't find<br>
But we got time<br>
And even though we might have lost tonight<br>
The skyline reminds us of a different time<br>
This is not the world we had in mind<br>
But we got time<br>
Broken smile, tired eyes<br>
I can feel your longing heart<br>
Call my name, howling from afar<br>
We've been fighting our demons just to stay afloat<br>
Been building a castle just to watch it fall<br>
Been running forever just to end up here, once more<br>
And now we know<br>
This is not the world we had in mind<br>
But we got time<br>
We are stuck on answers we can't find<br>
But we got time<br>
And even though we might have lost tonight<br>
The skyline reminds us of a different time<br>
This is not the world we had in mind<br>
But we got time<br>
Take me back<br>
Back to the mountainside<br>
Under the Northern Lights<br>
Chasing the stars<br>
Take me back<br>
Back to the mountainside<br>
When we were full of life<br>
Back to the start
And we both know that<br>
This is not the world we had in mind<br>
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find<br>
But we got time<br>
And even though we might have lost tonight<br>
The skyline reminds us of a different time<br>
This is not the world<br> we had in mind<br>
But we got time<br>
