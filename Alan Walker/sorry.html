<h2>Lyrics</h2>
   <p>
    Confetti is falling<br>
    At five in the morning<br>
    They're screaming and crying<br>
    But I'm all by myself<br>
    I know you, I'm sorry<br>
    I made up a story<br>
    I'm lonely, I'm falling<br>
    Just like you, I'm sorry<br>
    Lo-lo-ha-he-ey-yo-la<br>
    Lo-lo-ho-lo-le-lo-la<br>
    Lo-lo, lo-lo<br>
    Lo-lo-ho-lo-le-lo-la<br>
    Lo-lo-ho-lo-le-lo-la<br>
    Lo-lo-ho-lo-le-lo-la<br>
    Lo-lo-ho-lo-le-lo-la<br>
    Confetti is falling<br>
    At five in the morning<br>
    They're screaming and crying<br>
    But I'm all by myself<br>
    I know you, I'm sorry<br>
    I made up a story<br>
    I'm lonely, I'm falling<br>
    Just like you, I'm sorry<br>
    </p>
