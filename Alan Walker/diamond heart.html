<h2>Lyrics</h2>
   <p>
      
      Hello, sweet grief<br>
I know you'll be the death of me<br>
Feel like the morning after ecstasy<br>
I am drowning in an endless sea<br>
Hello, old friend<br>
Here's the misery that knows no end<br>
So I'm doing everything I can<br>
To make sure I never love again<br>
I wish that I did not know<br>
Where all broken lovers go<br>
I wish that my heart was made of stone<br>
Yeah, if I was bulletproof<br>
I'd love you black and blue<br>
If I was solid like a jewel<br>
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh<br>
I'd give you all my love, if I was unbreakable<br>
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh<br>
You could shoot me with a gun of gold, if I was unbreakable<br>
I'd walk straight through the bullet<br>
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish<br>
Never mind the bruises<br>
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires<br>
Give you all I've got (if I had a diamond heart)<br>
I'd walk straight through the dagger<br>
Never break the pattern<br>
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered<br>
Into the poison, cry you an ocean<br>
Give you all I've got
Goodbye, so long<br>
I don't know if this is right or wrong<br>
Am I giving up where I belong?<br>
'Cause every station's playing our song<br>
Goodbye, my love<br>
You are everything my dreams made up<br>
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove<br>
If I only were unbreakable<br>
I wish that I did not know (ooh)<br>
Where all broken lovers go (ooh)<br>
I wish that my heart was made of stone<br> (I wish that my heart was made of stone)<br>
Yeah, if I was bulletproof (bulletproof)<br>
I'd love you black and blue<br>
If I was solid like a jewel<br>
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh<br>
I'd give you all my love, if I was unbreakable<br>
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh<br>
You could shoot me with a gun of gold, if I was unbreakable<br>
I'd walk straight through the bullet<br>
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish<br>
Never mind the bruises<br>
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires<br>
Give you all I've got (if I had a diamond heart)<br>
I'd walk straight through the dagger<br>
Never break the pattern<br>
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered <br>
Into the poison, cry you an ocean<br>
Give you all I've got
Oh, la-la-la-la-la<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
This is the story (la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)<br>
I'd give you all my love (I'd give you)<br>
If I was unbreakable (the story, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)<br>
You could shoot me with a gun of gold (shoot)<br>
If I was unbreakable<br>
I'd walk straight through the bullet<br>
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish<br>
Never mind the bruises<br>
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires<br>
Give you all I've got (if I had a diamond heart)<br>
I'd walk straight<br> through the dagger
Never break the pattern<br>
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered<br>
Into the poison, cry you an ocean<br>
Give you all I've got
