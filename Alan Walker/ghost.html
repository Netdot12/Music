Today I'm kinda feelin' like a ghost
Call my friends but ain't nobody home
Tell myself I'm fine, but I don't really know
I'm just scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone
I never let it show
But I feel like a missed call on a phone
Tryna live my life pay as you go
But I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone
You know I'm like a ghost
Sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
You know I never meant to cut you off
Got phantom feelings I can never stop
Stranger things to worry 'bout I know
But I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone
I can't see myself in the mirror
Does that mean I'm not really here?
I'm losin' touch with everything I know
And I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone
You know I'm like a ghost
Sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
You know I'm like a ghost
Ooh, I'll be ok
I'll be alright
I know, ooh, I'll be ok
I'm just scared that I'll end up alone
You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
