  <p>
    The Walkerworld is finally here and it’s blowing the mind of The Walkers everywhere. “Heart over Mind” sees Alan Walker paying homage to the world he’s built over the years through his music and the “unity” he’s inspired amongst his massive fan base. The song, which features vocalist Daya, is about the struggles we go through when our heart wants us to choose a path that’s different from what we’re expected to be.

 <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <pre>
  
I should've locked the door
Pinned myself to the floor
Made someone cover my eyes
'Cause when the devil's on my left
Tellin' me to go ahead
You're right back in my mind
I'm a human tug of war
How do I cut the cord?
Feel like I'm stumbling blind
And with the angel on my right
Tellin' me to pick a side tonight
Too hard to fight
Heart over mind
Oh, you make me wanna throw my body into the fire
Should've known better 'cause you're dangerous
A painful love
Too nice, too hard to fight
Heart over mind
Oh, you make me wanna take you in and swallow my pride
Should've known better 'cause you're dangerous, a painful love
Too nice, too hard to fight
Heart over mind, oh
Too nice, too hard to fight
Heart over mind
You should've stayed away
Known what a mess you'd made
Said it's a bad idea (such a bad idea)
Should've picked kindness over cruel
What a stupid thing to do
Now I, I can't rewind
Heart over mind
Oh, you make me wanna throw my body into the fire
Should've known better 'cause you're dangerous
A painful love
Too nice, too hard to fight
Heart over mind
Oh, you make me wanna take you in and swallow my pride
Should've known better 'cause you're dangerous, a painful love
Too nice, too hard to fight
Heart over mind, oh
Too nice, too hard to fight
Heart over mind
Should've known better 'cause you're dangerous
A painful love
Too nice, too hard to fight
Heart over mind
