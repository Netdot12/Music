 <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <pre>
  I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Cold hands, red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
Waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you up high
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
And you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don't talk
And if they could, they'd say
Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you up high
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
I see those tears in your eyes
So helpless inside
There's no need to hide
Let me love you when your heart is tired
