 <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <pre>
  
Said you would rather die young
Live for the moment, forget tomorrow
Guess that you'll got it all wrong
Still tryna find out which road to follow
Always try to ride those paper planes
Said that you were fine with my mistakes
Now we're tryna call on yesterday
To go back
We don't always get it right
Then lights go out, the music dies, no goodbye
Now you're gonna realize
I cast us out of paradise
Even if it all went down in flames
We can live to fight another day
Let go and close your eyes
And just remember paradise
(I know)
(Paradise)
(I know)
It doesn't matter tonight
There's a tomorrow for you to treasure
No sense in losin' our minds
To keep the pieces of us together
Thought about it for a while now
Questioned everything up in your life now
Maybe you should let it ride out
And everything will come around, yeah
We don't always get it right
Then lights go out, the music dies, no goodbye
Now you're gonna realize
I cast us out of paradise
Even if it all went down in flames
We can live to fight another day
Let go and close your eyes
And just remember paradise
(I know)
(Paradise)
Hold on, hold on
(Paradise)
(Paradise)
(Paradise)
We don't always get it right
Then lights go out, the music dies, no goodbye
Now you're gonna realize
I cast us out of paradise (cast us out of paradise)
(I know)
(Paradise)
Wow, wow, oh
Cast us out
We don't always get it right
Then lights go out, the music dies (the music dies)
Now you're gonna realize
I cast us out of paradise
