    <h1>Lyrics</h1>
    
  <pre>
Hmm, yeah
Everything they ever liked
Don't see myself inside
Why can't I get it right?
I don't know
You're always watching me fall
Shadows, they like my wall
Why do I feel so small?
I don't know
So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside, no more
I lost, I lost
I lost control again
Always do the same and I'm to blame
I lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and I'm to blame
I lost control again
Oh, I am feeling afraid
But lately I lost my faith
What is love without pain?
It ain't home
You're watching me, but I'm in love
When I get caught, I hope
It's the kind of blackout that will
Take me home
So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside, no more
I lost, I lost
I lost control again
Always do the same and I'm to blame
I lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and I'm to blame
I lost control again
I know that I'm a mess
But I ain't tryna be the best
So, whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay
Never said I was an angel
I am damaged all the way
So, whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay
I lost, I lost
I lost control again
Always do the same and I'm to blame
I lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and I'm to blame
I lost control again
