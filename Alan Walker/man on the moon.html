 <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <pre>
  
What happens in dreams when we fly?
Never been as high as tonight
Staring through a window in time
For someone to show me what I'm like
He said, "Hello", it's like a mirror in the sky
And I can see us from up high
Oh boy, we're looking good tonight
And I just don't understand
I met the man on the moon
On the moon, I heard him saying
I met the man on the moon
On the moon, we'll be okay, yeah
I met the man on the moon, on the moon
I heard him say, yeah
I met the man on the moon, on the moon
We'll be okay, yeah
He said, "Hello", it's like a mirror in the sky
And I can see us from up high
Oh boy, we're looking good tonight
And I just don't understand
I met the man on the moon, on the moon
I heard him say, yeah
I met the man on the moon, on the moon
We'll be okay, yeah
I met the man on the moon, on the moon (on the moon, yeah)
I heard him say, yeah
I met the man on the moon, on the moon (yeah, on the moon)
We'll be okay, yeah
I met the man on the moon, he wore his hat to the side
I met the man on the moon, he asked if I had a light
He told us to hold it together, we're falling apart
He told us to light up the world when we dream in the dark, yeah
I met the man on the moon, on the moon (I met the man on the moon)
I heard him say, yeah
I met the man on the moon, on the moon (I met the man, yeah)
We'll be okay, yeah
Lost
All my tears have turned to dust
Maybe somebody is calling us
The man on the moon, yeah
Just a man on the moon
