    Lyrics
  </h2>
  <p>
hello, hello<br>
<br>
Can you hear me<br>
As I scream your name?<br>
<br>
Hello, hello<br>
<br>
Do you need me<br>
Before I fade away?<br>
<br>
Is this a place that I call home?<br>
To find what I've become<br>
Walk along the path unknown<br>
We live, we love, we lie<br>
<br>
Deep in the dark, I don't need the light<br>
There's a ghost inside me<br>
It all belongs to the other side<br>
We live, we love, we lie<br>
(We live, we love, we lie)<br>
<br>
Hello, hello<br>
<br>
Nice to meet you<br>
Voice inside my head<br>
<br>
Hello, hello<br>
<br>
I believe you<br>
How can I forget?<br>
<br>
Is this a place that I call home?<br>
To find what I've become<br>
Walk along the path unknown<br>
We live, we love, we lie<br>
<br>
Deep in the dark, I don't need the light<br>
There's a ghost inside me<br>
It all belongs to the other side<br>
We live, we love, we lie<br>
(We live, we love, we lie)<br>
<br>
We live, we love, we lie<br>
