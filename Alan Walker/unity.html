    Lyrics
  </h2>
  <p>
  In the dark of night<br>
The stars light up the sky<br>
We see them flying free<br>
That's just like you and me<br>
Everyone is lonely sometimes<br>
But I would walk a thousand miles to see your eyes<br>
You are not alone, we are family<br>
Hold me, let's escape all this reality<br>
You are my symphony<br>
By your side, we are unity<br>
You are my energy<br>
My guiding light, we are unity<br>
We are unity<br>
(We are, we are)<br>
We are unity<br>
Although the rain might pour<br>
A thunder starts to roar<br>
The lightning wakes the wave<br>
But through it, we are brave<br>
Everyone is lonely sometimes<br>
But I would walk a thousand miles to see your eyes<br>
You are not alone, we are family<br>
Hold me, let's escape all this reality<br>
You are my symphony<br>
By your side, we are unity<br>
You are my energy<br>
My guiding light, we are unity<br>
We are unity<br>
(We are, we are)<br>
We are unity<br>
We are unity<br>
You are my symphony (we are)<br>
By your side (we are unity)
You are my energy (we are)<br>
My guiding light (we are unity)<br>
We are unity (unity, unity)<br>
We are unity<br>
