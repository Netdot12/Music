    "Darkside" is a song by British-Norwegian record producer and DJ Alan Walker, featuring Antiguan-German singer-songwriter Au/Ra and Norwegian singer Tomine Harket. The song was released on July 27, 2018, via Mer Musikk and Ultra Music. Two remixes were released, one by Austrian DJ and producer LUM!X and one by Afrojack in collaboration with Chasner. Neither, however, were officially published by Walker's YouTube channel.

  <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    
    
  <p>
    We're not in love<br>
    We share no stories<br>
    Just something in your eyes<br>
    Don't be afraid<br>
    The shadows know me<br>
    Let's leave the world behind<br><br> <!-- Line break added -->
    Take me through the night<br>
    Fall into the dark side<br>
    We don't need the light<br>
    We'll live on the dark side<br>
    I see it, let's feel it<br>
    While we're still young and fearless<br>
    Let go of the light<br>
    Fall into the dark side<br>
    Fall into the dark side<br>
    Give into the dark side<br>
    Let go of the light<br>
    Fall into the dark side<br><br> <!-- Line break added -->
    Beneath the sky<br>
    As black as diamonds<br>
    We're running out of time (time, time)<br>
    Don't wait for truth<br>
    To come and blind us<br>
    Let's just believe their lies<br><br> <!-- Line break added -->
    Believe it, I see it<br>
    I know that you can feel it<br>
    No secrets worth keeping<br>
    So fool me like I'm dreaming<br>
    Take me through the night<br>
    Fall into the dark side<br>
    We don't need the light<br>
    We'll live on the dark side<br>
    I see it, let's feel it<br>
    While we're still young and fearless<br>
    Let go of the light<br>
    Fall into the dark side<br><br> <!-- Line break added -->
    Fall into the dark side<br>
    Give into the dark side<br>
    Let go of the light<br>
    Fall into the dark side<br>
    Take me through the night<br>
    Fall into the dark side<br>
    We don't need the light<br>
    We'll live on the dark side<br>
    I see it, let's feel it<br>
    While we're still young and fearless<br>
    Let go of the light<br>
    Fall into the dark side
